## About

**DISCONTINUED BECAUSE NOW USING GO AND GTK**

I wanted to have something like [cerebro](https://github.com/KELiON/cerebro/) and spotlight for Linux and Windows.<br>
Inspirations are from these two applications and also some code parts may be reused from cerebro for easiness.<br>
This project is made with Electron

## Available Scripts

### `npm run dev`

Launches the react app (`npm run start`) in non-browser mode and then the electron app

### `npm run dev:win`

Does the same as above but for windows because you cant set environment variables like on Linux

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
